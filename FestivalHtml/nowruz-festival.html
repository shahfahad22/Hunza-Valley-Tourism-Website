    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Nowroz is a beautiful and spiritual spring festival celebrated with great enthusiasm in the Hunza Valley, especially among the Ismaili Muslim community.
      The word “Nowroz” means "New Day" in Persian. It marks the beginning of the new solar year and the start of spring, symbolizing renewal, rebirth, and hope.
      Hunza shares this tradition with Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, and other parts of northern Pakistan like Gilgit, Chitral, and Skardu—but its flavor in Hunza is truly unique.
    </p>

    <h2>Timing</h2>
    <p>
      Celebrated on <strong>March 21st</strong> every year. <br>
      Coincides with the spring equinox, when day and night are equal in length. <br>
      Marks the start of the Persian calendar year and the end of winter.
    </p>

    <h2>Where It Is Celebrated</h2>
    <p>
      Widely observed in Central Hunza (Karimabad, Aliabad) and Upper Hunza (Gojal: Gulmit, Passu, Sost). <br>
      Also celebrated in some areas of Nagar Valley.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Symbolism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spiritual Renewal:</strong> Time for self-reflection, purification, and spiritual awareness.</li>
      <li><strong>New Beginnings:</strong> Like a "new year" – people start fresh with clean homes and clean hearts.</li>
      <li><strong>Spring Celebration:</strong> Nature awakens—flowers bloom, snow melts, birds sing.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural Identity:</strong> Celebrating Nowroz shows the deep Persian-Central Asian influence on Hunza's culture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
      Nowroz has been celebrated for over 3,000 years, dating back to the Zoroastrian era in ancient Persia. <br>
      It was embraced by Ismaili Muslims and brought to Hunza through Silk Road connections. <br>
      The festival was historically supported by Mir(s) of Hunza and passed down as a tradition of joy, unity, and renewal.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Activities and Traditions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>House Cleaning and Decoration:</strong>
        People thoroughly clean their homes days before Nowroz—called “khana shahi”. Homes are decorated with flowers, fabrics, and lights. It’s believed that clean spaces attract blessings for the new year.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wearing New Clothes:</strong>
        Everyone wears new or freshly washed clothes, often traditional Hunza attire. Women wear colorful frocks and jewelry; men wear waistcoats, shalwar kameez, and Hunza caps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Special Prayers (Du'a):</strong>
        Community members gather at Jamat Khanas (Ismaili prayer houses) for special Nowroz Du’as and spiritual talks. Prayers focus on peace, prosperity, and unity for the new year.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preparing the Haft Seen Table:</strong>
        Inspired by Persian culture, some families set up a Haft-Seen (Seven S-symbols) table with:
        <ul>
          <li>Sabzeh (green sprouts)</li>
          <li>Sib (apple)</li>
          <li>Sir (garlic)</li>
          <li>Samanu (wheat pudding)</li>
          <li>Serkeh (vinegar)</li>
          <li>Sumac (spice)</li>
          <li>Senjed (dried fruit)</li>
        </ul>
        Each item represents life, health, love, and patience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cultural Dances and Music:</strong>
        Traditional dances (Damaan) are performed in open spaces. Folk songs about spring, joy, and community are sung. Instruments like rubab, drums, and flutes are played by local musicians.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sharing Sweets and Dishes:</strong>
        Delicious food is prepared and shared among families and neighbors. Popular Nowroz foods in Hunza include:

          <li>Giyaling (honey flatbread)</li>
          <li>Boiled eggs (symbolizing rebirth)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visiting Friends and Relatives:</strong>
        People visit each other, forgive past grudges, and start fresh. Children receive small gifts, money, or sweets—like an Eidi.
      </li>

    <h2>Symbolic Meaning of Nowroz in Hunza</h2>
    <p>
      Represents light over darkness, love over hatred, and hope over despair. <br>
      Symbolizes a bridge between the natural world (spring) and the spiritual world (renewal of the soul). <br>
      A time to reconnect with roots, nature, and community.
    </p>

      <li>The spiritual calmness and beauty of the region</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
